Crawling.mcc/Crawling.mcc

   Crawling.mcc was originally developed by Klaus Melchior.
   This is a native reimplementation included with MUI3.9 for convenience.

   Crawling.mcc is a subclass of MUIC_Virtgroup but with timed vertical
   scrolling. It will start to scroll the content after approx. 10 seconds and
   then repeatingly restart the scrolling again again after approx. 30 seconds.

   To use Crawling.mcc you create it like any other VirtGroup object. To avoid
   jumping from the last object back to the first object in the group these two
   objects should be identical and in optimal case have the exact height of your
   Crawling object.


   EXAMPLE

   #include <mui/Crawling_mcc.h>

   CONST_STRPTR introstring = "\33cMUI is great!";

   Child, CrawlingObject,
       MUIA_Frame,        MUIV_Frame_Text,
       MUIA_Background,   MUII_TextBack,

       Child, VGroup,
           Child, TextObject,
               MUIA_Text_Contents, introstring,
           End,

           [ ... more objects here ... ]

           /*
            * for smooth scrolling we add a clone of our first object at the end too
            */
           Child, TextObject,
               MUIA_Text_Contents, introstring,
           End,
