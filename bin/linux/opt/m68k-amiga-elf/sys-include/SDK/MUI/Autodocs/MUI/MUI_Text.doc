	Text class allows generating objects that contain
	some kind of text. You can control the outfit of
	your text with some special control characters,
	including italics, bold, underline and color
	codes. Format codes align text either left,
	centered or right, linefeeds allow multiline
	text fields.
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_Contents

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_Contents -- (V4 ) [ISG], STRPTR, 0x8042f8dc

    FUNCTION
	String to be displayed in a text object.

	If the string is larger than available display space,
	it will be clipped. Setting MUIA_Text_Contents to NULL
	results in an empty text object.

	The string is copied into a private buffer, you can destroy
	the original after using this tag.

	Whenever MUI prints strings, they may contain some special
	character sequences defining format, color and style of the text.

	'\n'	 Start a new line. With this character you can e.g. create
		 multi line buttons.

	ESC -    Disable text engine, following chars will be printed
	         without further parsing.

	ESC u    Set the soft style to underline.

	ESC b    Set the soft style to bold.

	ESC i    Set the soft style to italic.

	ESC n    Set the soft style back to normal.

	ESC <n>  Use pen number n (2..9) as front pen. n must be a valid
		 DrawInfo pen as specified in "intuition/screens.h".

	ESC c    Center current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or directly following a newline character.

	ESC r    Right justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or directly following a newline character.

	ESC l    Left justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or directly following a newline character.

	ESC I[s] Draw MUI image with specification <s>. See autodocs
	         of image class for image spec definition.

	ESC p[p]
	ESC P[p] Pen number

	ESC p[RRGGBB]
		 Direct RGB color value for truecolor displays.

	ESC P[RRGGBB]
	ESC P[AARRGGBB]
	ESC P[AA------]
		 Direct (A)RGB value specifying text color on truecolor displays.
		 When AA------ is used, currently set color	is not altered,
		 only its alpha value (transparency).

	ESC A[x] Draw raw ARGB data taken from struct MUI_AlphaData pointed to
		 by <x>, i.e. "\033A[deadbeef]". The address may be prefixed with
		 a '$'.

	ESC O[x]
	ESC O[x,width]
		 Draw a MUI object pointed to by <x>, i.e. "\033O[deadbeef]". The
		 address may be prefixed with a '$'. The additional width value is
		 optional. If it is omitted the object will be queried for its
		 minimum width.

	Note:    These rules apply to all MUI strings, not only to
	         a text objects contents. You can e.g. format the
	         columns of a listview or include images in a cycle
	         gadgets entries.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Text_Contents, "\33c\33bMUI\33n\nis magic"
	...

	would look like     |    MUI   |  <-- bold
	                    | is magic |  <-- normal

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_ControlChar

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_ControlChar -- (V20) [ISG], char, 0x8042e6d0

    FUNCTION
	If the character given here exists in the displayed
	string (no matter if upper or lower case), it will
	be underlined. This makes it easy to create macros
	such as KeyButton() that specify the control char
	and the underline char at the same time.

	In contrast to MUIA_Text_HiChar the underlining does
	NOT happen by inserting text styles as this might
	break other active styles.

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_Copy

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_Copy -- (V20) [ISG], BOOL, 0x80427727

    FUNCTION
	When set to FALSE, the contents will not be copied to a
	private buffer. Defaults to TRUE, unless MUIA_Text_HiChar
	is also specified.

	SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Text_Contents, MUIA_Text_HiChar
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_HiChar

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_HiChar -- (V4 ) [I..], char, 0x804218ff

    FUNCTION
	If the character given here exists in the displayed
	string (no matter if upper or lower case), it will
	be underlined. This makes it easy to create macros
	such as KeyButton() that specify the control char
	and the underline char at the same time.

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_PreParse

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_PreParse -- (V4 ) [ISG], STRPTR, 0x8042566d

    FUNCTION
	String containing format definitions to be parsed before
	the text from MUIA_Text_Contents is printed.

	Using this tag, you can easily define different formats,
	colors and styles without modifying the original string.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Text_PreParse, "\33c\33i",   // centered and italics
	MUIA_Text_Contents, "foobar",
	...

    SEE_ALSO
	MUIA_Text_Contents
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetMax

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetMax -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x80424d0a

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate wether the objects maximal width
	shall be calculated to fit the string given with
	MUIA_Text_Contents.

	When set to FALSE, maximum width is not limited.

	For a text object that needs to be updated (e.g. some
	information about your programs status) you would probably
	set MUIA_Text_SetMax to FALSE to allow resizing of this
	object.

	For a label for one of your gadgets, you might want to
	give this tag a value of TRUE to prevent MUI from
	inserting additional layout space.

	Defaults to FALSE.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	TX_Status = TextObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   MUIA_Background   , MUII_BACKGROUND,
	   MUIA_Text_PreParse, "\33c",
	   MUIA_Text_Contents, "running...",
	   End,
	...
	set(TX_Status,MUIA_Text_Contents,"reading...");
	...
	set(TX_Status,MUIA_Text_Contents,"writing...");
	...

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetMin

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetMin -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x80424e10

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate wether the objects minimal width
	shall be calculated to fit the string given with
	MUIA_Text_Contents.

	When set to FALSE, minimum width will be set to 0
	and the displayed string may be clipped.

	Defaults to TRUE.

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetVMax

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetVMax -- (V11) [IS.], BOOL, 0x80420d8b

    FUNCTION
	Settings this to FALSE makes a TextObjects y-size unlimited.
	Defaults to TRUE which means the objects height is fixed.
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_Shorten

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_Shorten -- (V20) [ISG], LONG, 0x80428bbd

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Text_Shorten_Nothing
	MUIV_Text_Shorten_Cutoff
	MUIV_Text_Shorten_Hide

    FUNCTION
	This attribute controls whether MUI is allowed to shorten
	the text to be displayed and how this shortening process
	will be done.
	MUIV_Text_Shorten_Hide will hide all text completely if there
	is not enough space.
	MUIA_Text_Shortened can be used to check whether the text was
	actually shortened or not.

	Defaults to MUIV_Text_Shorten_Nothing.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	TX_Status = TextObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   MUIA_Background   , MUII_BACKGROUND,
	   MUIA_Text_PreParse, "\33c",
	   MUIA_Text_Contents, "running...",
	   MUIA_Text_Shorten, MUIV_Text_Shorten_Hide,
	   End,

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_Shortened

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_Shortened -- (V20) [..G], BOOL, 0x80425a86

    FUNCTION
	This attribute can be used to check whether the text objects
	contents were shortened to be able to keep up the current GUI
	layout.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	ULONG shortened;
	get(obj, MUIA_Text_Shortened, &shortened);
	if(shortened)
	  printf("text was shortened\n");
	else
	  printf("text was displayed completely\n");
